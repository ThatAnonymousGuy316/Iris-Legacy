/**
 * A damage amount, as a native abstract over `Int`.
 *
 * Note what is NOT on this type: `@:build(hxscript.macro.AbstractMacro.build())`. An abstract has
 * no runtime representation, so a script handed one would see nothing -- no methods, no operators,
 * no `from`/`to`. The build macro emits a reflectable wrapper that gives it one, and it is applied
 * to this type from OUTSIDE, by `macros/AbstractsMacro.hx`.
 *
 * That is the arrangement worth copying: the abstracts a real host wants scriptable are mostly in
 * libraries it does not own, so it cannot annotate them. Applying the macro externally works the
 * same either way, and this type stays a plain abstract that compiled code uses without knowing
 * anything about scripting.
 *
 * None of these members is `inline`, and that is deliberate. An `inline` method has no runtime
 * representation for the wrapper to expose, so it stays invisible to scripts however the macro
 * is applied -- the call fails with `Cannot call null`. Compiled callers lose the inlining; a
 * member a script has to reach has to exist.
