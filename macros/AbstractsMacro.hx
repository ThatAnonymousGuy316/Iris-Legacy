/**
 * Makes the build's abstracts usable from scripts, without touching the abstracts themselves.
 *
 * `hxscript.macro.AbstractMacro` emits the reflectable wrapper an abstract needs to exist at
 * runtime, but it is a `@:build` macro, so something has to apply it. Writing
 * `@:build(hxscript.macro.AbstractMacro.build())` on your own abstract is fine; the abstracts a
 * host actually wants scriptable are usually in libraries it does not own, and those cannot be
 * annotated. `Compiler.addMetadata` applies it from outside, which works for both.
 *
 * This scans a package for `abstract` declarations rather than keeping a hand-written list. A list
 * is discovered the hard way: a runtime "Unknown identifier" from somebody's script, then a rebuild
 * to add one line.
 *
 * Two shapes are known to break the generator, so a package-wide filter is not an option -- it does
 * not degrade on them, it fails the build:
 *
 * - an `enum abstract` with a value-less constructor (`var Red;` with no `= 0`), and
 * - an abstract whose members call each other unqualified.
 *
 * Name those in `EXCLUDE`. A real host scans several packages and skips more; see
 * [docs/advanced.md](../../../docs/advanced.md) for the flixel and openfl lists.
 *
 * Applying the macro is only half of it: the abstract also has to BE in the build. A type nothing
 * compiled references is never typed, and metadata on a type that does not exist does nothing --
 * the script then fails with `Type not found`, which does not point at the cause. Pair this with
 * an include of the same package.
 *
 * Run it from the build:
 *
 *     --macro macros.AbstractsMacro.generate() --macro include('game')
